<h1>
    It&#x27;s really easy to make a website
</h1>

<h3>At least one like this</h3>

<p>I created this site in late 2020, using <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.<br />
I have long been admiring people that regularly write interesting articles (e.g. <a href="https://fasterthanli.me">https://fasterthanli.me</a>, <a href="https://christine.website/">https://christine.website/</a>, <a href="https://endler.dev/">https://endler.dev/</a>, not exhaustive of course), but I struggled to find the motivation and courage to write something myself.</p>
<p>Then, last year, my good friend <a href="https://andrewru.com/">Andre</a> started pushing me to start writing and actually succeeded, which amazed me more than anyone else...
I didn't put much effort into the site so far (as you can see), but I was quite happy with the experience I had using Zola and Github Pages</p>
<p>Anyway, he recently created his own site and put it on his own domain - which is something I put off for a while because I didn't want to enter another rabbit hole.
But seeing that he just got his own domain, I figured I could just ask him where he got it and try it.</p>
<p>I did that, he gave me the name of a popular registrar, I tried it out, and 30 minutes later my blog was reachable under my own domain.
This was a really pleasant surprise to me as I really did not expect anything even remotely related to DNS to go that smoothly.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point of this post is to encourage you to make your own site and/or get your own domain<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#encouragement-disclaimer">1</a></sup>!
Feel free to use something more mainstream if you want to<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#rustacean">2</a></sup>, but Zola worked very well for me and I'm quite happy with its documentation<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#zola-docs">3</a></sup> as well.</p>
<p>The web really needs more personal websites.
Make your own.
And make it like <a href="https://fasterthanli.me">Amos'</a>, <a href="https://christine.website/">Christine's</a> or <a href="https://endler.dev/">Matthias'</a>, not like mine ðŸ˜…</p>

<p>at least if you've just been putting it off because it sounded like a hassle to you, like I have</p>

<p>I just chose Zola because I'm a big ol Rustacean</p>
