I created this site in late 2020, using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
I have long been admiring people that regularly write interesting articles (e.g. [https://fasterthanli.me](https://fasterthanli.me), [https://christine.website/](https://christine.website/), [https://endler.dev/](https://endler.dev/), not exhaustive of course), but I struggled to find the motivation and courage to write something myself.

Then, last year, my good friend [Andre](https://andrewru.com/) started pushing me to start writing and actually succeeded, which amazed me more than anyone else...
I didn't put much effort into the site so far (as you can see), but I was quite happy with the experience I had using Zola and Github Pages

Anyway, he recently created his own site and put it on his own domain - which is something I put off for a while because I didn't want to enter another rabbit hole.
But seeing that he just got his own domain, I figured I could just ask him where he got it and try it.

I did that, he gave me the name of a popular registrar, I tried it out, and 30 minutes later my blog was reachable under my own domain.
This was a really pleasant surprise to me as I really did not expect anything even remotely related to DNS to go that smoothly.

Anyway, the point of this post is to encourage you to make your own site and/or get your own domain[^encouragement-disclaimer]!
Feel free to use something more mainstream if you want to[^rustacean], but Zola worked very well for me and I'm quite happy with its documentation[^zola-docs] as well.

The web really needs more personal websites.
Make your own.
And make it like [Amos'](https://fasterthanli.me), [Christine's](https://christine.website/) or [Matthias'](https://endler.dev/), not like mine ðŸ˜…

[^encouragement-disclaimer]: at least if you've just been putting it off because it sounded like a hassle to you, like I have

[^rustacean]: I just chose Zola because I'm a big ol Rustacean
